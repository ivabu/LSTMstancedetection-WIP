       "      <td>When Tim Cook finally announced the long-awaited Apple Watch on September 9, the company promised an “early 2015” release. Since then, it’s really been anybody’s guess as to when, exactly, that might end up being. A few new rumors, however, suggest that we’ll get the Apple Watch sometime in February…but it’s likely that it’ll be later than that.\\n\\nToday, a post on 9to5Mac points the way back to a report from Chinese site Feng, which itself cites “Taiwanese media” as saying that the Apple Watch is likely to hit sometime in February, though not without a fair bit of challenges to overcome. The reports say that the supply of sapphire crystal – which will compose the displays of the highest-end Apple Watch units – has led to some difficulties in manufacturing.\\n\\nHowever, it should be noted that if sapphire is the biggest problem facing the Apple Watch, then Apple’s in good shape. The software itself is still in development, and as the 9to5Mac post points out, the company has yet to release the WatchKit SDK for developers to start making all the cool apps that’ll run on the device.\\n\\nAnother report from Asia this week claims that production on the Apple Watch isn’t set to start at manufacturing partner Quanta until sometime in January – and with only a month of actual production, it seems doubtful that Apple would truly be ready to sell the Watch by February. And last week, an unnamed Apple insider was quoted as saying that the company would be “lucky to ship it by Valentine’s Day.” If that quote is true, then February seems like a tall order.\\n\\nThat said, March doesn’t seem too out of the question. Nor does April. In fact, considering that Motorola promised the Moto 360 smartwatch by “summer 2014,” and didn’t launch it until early September, it would seem that OEMs are pretty loose about their definitions for launch windows. “Early 2015” is simply anything before the very last day in June. And barring any major disasters, we should start to see Apple Watches on consumers’ wrists long before then.\\n\\nThe main question, though, is what cool stuff will the competition cook up between then and now…</td>\n",

       "      <td>Fear not arachnophobes, the story of Bunbury's \"spiderman\" might not be all it seemed.\\n\\nPerth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man's body during his first trip to Bali. The story went global on Thursday, generating hundreds of stories online.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing \"a really burning sensation like a searing feeling\" in his abdomen.\\n\\nDylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin.\\n\\nThomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a \"tropical spider\".\\n\\nBut it seems we may have all been caught in a web... of misinformation.\\n\\nArachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was, it was \"almost impossible\" for the culprit to have been a spider.\\n\\n\"If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We thought it may have been something like a mite, there are a few different parasitic mites out there, which can sometimes look a bit like a spider. I can't think of any spider which could do this to a person.\"\\n\\nDr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case \"bizarre\".\\n\\n\"I must confess I was amazed because I've never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human, or indeed any mammal,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive.\\n\\n\"Even if it was a mite, I've never seen anything like this. Even if it was an insect, I've never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this, so it really is a remarkable case.\"\\n\\nDr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends.\\n\"We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin. Then [the baby spiders] burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics,\" he said.\\n\\n\"None of those are true, they're just made up stories.\\n\\n\"They're not actually able to dig through the skin, that's why this case is so unusual. Some can burrow into soil, but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that.\"\\n\\nSomething which is true, according to Dr Harvey, is that certain arachnids do \"live on humans\".\\n\\n\"We all have mites living on our faces. They're follicle mites, but they're absolutely miniscule and you can't see them. We transmit them to our children when we have kids,\" he said.\\n\\n\"They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin. Those mites are so small, you can't see them, and they're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach.\"\\n\\nDr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender, dead or alive, and enlisting the help of experts.\\n\\n\"It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it,\" he said.\\n\\n\"If you have been bitten by something, the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral.\"\\n\\nDylan Thomas has been contacted for comment.\\n\\n- WA Today</td>\n",

Since then, it’s really been anybody’s guess as to when, exactly, that might end up being. A few new rumors, however, suggest that we’ll get the Apple Watch sometime in February…but it’s likely that it’ll be later than that.\\n\\nToday, a post on 9to5Mac points the way back to a report from Chinese site Feng, which itself cites “Taiwanese media” as saying that the Apple Watch is likely to hit sometime in February, though not without a fair bit of challenges to overcome. The reports say that the supply of sapphire crystal – which will compose the displays of the highest-end Apple Watch units – has led to some difficulties in manufacturing.\\n\\nHowever, it should be noted that if sapphire is the biggest problem facing the Apple Watch, then Apple’s in good shape. The software itself is still in development, and as the 9to5Mac post points out, the company has yet to release the WatchKit SDK for developers to start making all the cool apps that’ll run on the device.\\n\\nAnother report from Asia this week claims that production on the Apple Watch isn’t set to start at manufacturing partner Quanta until sometime in January – and with only a month of actual production, it seems doubtful that Apple would truly be ready to sell the Watch by February. And last week, an unnamed Apple insider was quoted as saying that the company would be “lucky to ship it by Valentine’s Day.” If that quote is true, then February seems like a tall order.\\n\\nThat said, March doesn’t seem too out of the question. Nor does April. In fact, considering that Motorola promised the Moto 360 smartwatch by “summer 2014,” and didn’t launch it until early September, it would seem that OEMs are pretty loose about their definitions for launch windows. “Early 2015” is simply anything before the very last day in June. And barring any major disasters, we should start to see Apple Watches on consumers’ wrists long before then.\\n\\nThe main question, though, is what cool stuff will the competition cook up between then and now…   \n",
       "1  Fear not arachnophobes, the story of Bunbury's \"spiderman\" might not be all it seemed.\\n\\nPerth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man's body during his first trip to Bali. The story went global on Thursday, generating hundreds of stories online.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing \"a really burning sensation like a searing feeling\" in his abdomen.\\n\\nDylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin.\\n\\nThomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a \"tropical spider\".\\n\\nBut it seems we may have all been caught in a web... of misinformation.\\n\\nArachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was, it was \"almost impossible\" for the culprit to have been a spider.\\n\\n\"If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We thought it may have been something like a mite, there are a few different parasitic mites out there, which can sometimes look a bit like a spider. I can't think of any spider which could do this to a person.\"\\n\\nDr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case \"bizarre\".\\n\\n\"I must confess I was amazed because I've never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human, or indeed any mammal,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive.\\n\\n\"Even if it was a mite, I've never seen anything like this. Even if it was an insect, I've never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this, so it really is a remarkable case.\"\\n\\nDr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends.\\n\"We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin. Then [the baby spiders] burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics,\" he said.\\n\\n\"None of those are true, they're just made up stories.\\n\\n\"They're not actually able to dig through the skin, that's why this case is so unusual. Some can burrow into soil, but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that.\"\\n\\nSomething which is true, according to Dr Harvey, is that certain arachnids do \"live on humans\".\\n\\n\"We all have mites living on our faces. They're follicle mites, but they're absolutely miniscule and you can't see them. We transmit them to our children when we have kids,\" he said.\\n\\n\"They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin. Those mites are so small, you can't see them, and they're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach.\"\\n\\nDr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender, dead or alive, and enlisting the help of experts.\\n\\n\"It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it,\" he said.\\n\\n\"If you have been bitten by something, the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral.\"\\n\\nDylan Thomas has been contacted for comment.\\n\\n- WA Today   \n",

       "      <td>When Tim Cook finally announced the long-awaited Apple Watch on September 9, the company promised an “early 2015” release. Since then, it’s really been anybody’s guess as to when, exactly, that might end up being. A few new rumors, however, suggest that we’ll get the Apple Watch sometime in February…but it’s likely that it’ll be later than that.\\n\\nToday, a post on 9to5Mac points the way back to a report from Chinese site Feng, which itself cites “Taiwanese media” as saying that the Apple Watch is likely to hit sometime in February, though not without a fair bit of challenges to overcome. The reports say that the supply of sapphire crystal – which will compose the displays of the highest-end Apple Watch units – has led to some difficulties in manufacturing.\\n\\nHowever, it should be noted that if sapphire is the biggest problem facing the Apple Watch, then Apple’s in good shape. The software itself is still in development, and as the 9to5Mac post points out, the company has yet to release the WatchKit SDK for developers to start making all the cool apps that’ll run on the device.\\n\\nAnother report from Asia this week claims that production on the Apple Watch isn’t set to start at manufacturing partner Quanta until sometime in January – and with only a month of actual production, it seems doubtful that Apple would truly be ready to sell the Watch by February. And last week, an unnamed Apple insider was quoted as saying that the company would be “lucky to ship it by Valentine’s Day.” If that quote is true, then February seems like a tall order.\\n\\nThat said, March doesn’t seem too out of the question. Nor does April. In fact, considering that Motorola promised the Moto 360 smartwatch by “summer 2014,” and didn’t launch it until early September, it would seem that OEMs are pretty loose about their definitions for launch windows. “Early 2015” is simply anything before the very last day in June. And barring any major disasters, we should start to see Apple Watches on consumers’ wrists long before then.\\n\\nThe main question, though, is what cool stuff will the competition cook up between then and now…</td>\n",

       "      <td>Fear not arachnophobes, the story of Bunbury's \"spiderman\" might not be all it seemed.\\n\\nPerth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man's body during his first trip to Bali. The story went global on Thursday, generating hundreds of stories online.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing \"a really burning sensation like a searing feeling\" in his abdomen.\\n\\nDylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin.\\n\\nThomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a \"tropical spider\".\\n\\nBut it seems we may have all been caught in a web... of misinformation.\\n\\nArachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was, it was \"almost impossible\" for the culprit to have been a spider.\\n\\n\"If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We thought it may have been something like a mite, there are a few different parasitic mites out there, which can sometimes look a bit like a spider. I can't think of any spider which could do this to a person.\"\\n\\nDr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case \"bizarre\".\\n\\n\"I must confess I was amazed because I've never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human, or indeed any mammal,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive.\\n\\n\"Even if it was a mite, I've never seen anything like this. Even if it was an insect, I've never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this, so it really is a remarkable case.\"\\n\\nDr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends.\\n\"We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin. Then [the baby spiders] burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics,\" he said.\\n\\n\"None of those are true, they're just made up stories.\\n\\n\"They're not actually able to dig through the skin, that's why this case is so unusual. Some can burrow into soil, but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that.\"\\n\\nSomething which is true, according to Dr Harvey, is that certain arachnids do \"live on humans\".\\n\\n\"We all have mites living on our faces. They're follicle mites, but they're absolutely miniscule and you can't see them. We transmit them to our children when we have kids,\" he said.\\n\\n\"They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin. Those mites are so small, you can't see them, and they're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach.\"\\n\\nDr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender, dead or alive, and enlisting the help of experts.\\n\\n\"It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it,\" he said.\\n\\n\"If you have been bitten by something, the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral.\"\\n\\nDylan Thomas has been contacted for comment.\\n\\n- WA Today</td>\n",

Since then, it’s really been anybody’s guess as to when, exactly, that might end up being. A few new rumors, however, suggest that we’ll get the Apple Watch sometime in February…but it’s likely that it’ll be later than that.\\n\\nToday, a post on 9to5Mac points the way back to a report from Chinese site Feng, which itself cites “Taiwanese media” as saying that the Apple Watch is likely to hit sometime in February, though not without a fair bit of challenges to overcome. The reports say that the supply of sapphire crystal – which will compose the displays of the highest-end Apple Watch units – has led to some difficulties in manufacturing.\\n\\nHowever, it should be noted that if sapphire is the biggest problem facing the Apple Watch, then Apple’s in good shape. The software itself is still in development, and as the 9to5Mac post points out, the company has yet to release the WatchKit SDK for developers to start making all the cool apps that’ll run on the device.\\n\\nAnother report from Asia this week claims that production on the Apple Watch isn’t set to start at manufacturing partner Quanta until sometime in January – and with only a month of actual production, it seems doubtful that Apple would truly be ready to sell the Watch by February. And last week, an unnamed Apple insider was quoted as saying that the company would be “lucky to ship it by Valentine’s Day.” If that quote is true, then February seems like a tall order.\\n\\nThat said, March doesn’t seem too out of the question. Nor does April. In fact, considering that Motorola promised the Moto 360 smartwatch by “summer 2014,” and didn’t launch it until early September, it would seem that OEMs are pretty loose about their definitions for launch windows. “Early 2015” is simply anything before the very last day in June. And barring any major disasters, we should start to see Apple Watches on consumers’ wrists long before then.\\n\\nThe main question, though, is what cool stuff will the competition cook up between then and now…   \n",
       "1  Fear not arachnophobes, the story of Bunbury's \"spiderman\" might not be all it seemed.\\n\\nPerth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man's body during his first trip to Bali. The story went global on Thursday, generating hundreds of stories online.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing \"a really burning sensation like a searing feeling\" in his abdomen.\\n\\nDylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin.\\n\\nThomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a \"tropical spider\".\\n\\nBut it seems we may have all been caught in a web... of misinformation.\\n\\nArachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was, it was \"almost impossible\" for the culprit to have been a spider.\\n\\n\"If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We thought it may have been something like a mite, there are a few different parasitic mites out there, which can sometimes look a bit like a spider. I can't think of any spider which could do this to a person.\"\\n\\nDr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case \"bizarre\".\\n\\n\"I must confess I was amazed because I've never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human, or indeed any mammal,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive.\\n\\n\"Even if it was a mite, I've never seen anything like this. Even if it was an insect, I've never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this, so it really is a remarkable case.\"\\n\\nDr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends.\\n\"We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin. Then [the baby spiders] burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics,\" he said.\\n\\n\"None of those are true, they're just made up stories.\\n\\n\"They're not actually able to dig through the skin, that's why this case is so unusual. Some can burrow into soil, but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that.\"\\n\\nSomething which is true, according to Dr Harvey, is that certain arachnids do \"live on humans\".\\n\\n\"We all have mites living on our faces. They're follicle mites, but they're absolutely miniscule and you can't see them. We transmit them to our children when we have kids,\" he said.\\n\\n\"They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin. Those mites are so small, you can't see them, and they're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach.\"\\n\\nDr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender, dead or alive, and enlisting the help of experts.\\n\\n\"It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it,\" he said.\\n\\n\"If you have been bitten by something, the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral.\"\\n\\nDylan Thomas has been contacted for comment.\\n\\n- WA Today   \n",
